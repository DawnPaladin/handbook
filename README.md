# Handbook

My notes and code samples from learning various programming languages.

I wrote a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@DawnPaladin/creating-a-simple-documentation-site-in-markdown-2ef2fb3ffcf7#.2f5wma9mb) about how I set this up, if you're interested in creating your own. [Contact me](https://twitter.com/DawnPaladin) if you have any questions!

## Setup

`npm install -g harp`

`harp server`

`harp compile . docs`
